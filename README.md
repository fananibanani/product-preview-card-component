## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS (mainly for easy variable usage and nesting)
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project served as my introduction to using Git/Github version control and learning how to make wise choices about bringing a design to life.

This was the first time I really used a mobile-first workflow as well as SCSS. While there are definitely many areas to improve in even with such a simple project, I learned a lot about creating responsive web pages. My main areas of learning this time around were: testing tools (Chrome DevTools, Google Lighthouse, Narrator for accessibility testing), SCSS compilation to CSS, more intricate details of flexbox.

### Continued development

This project brought up the topics of using SCSS and of accessibility, both of which I don't have a lot of knowledge in yet but definitely want to improve in. For future projects, I plan to learn more about web accessibility, how to test the accessibility of web applications, and learn more about SCSS and how to use it in bigger projects.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me to understand flex item spacing.
- [aria-label is a code smell](https://ericwbailey.website/published/aria-label-is-a-code-smell/) - This helped me understand why my aria-labels on span elements didn't get picked up by Narrator, and how to proceed (include extra explanatory text for screen readers, but hide the text with CSS).
- [Hide text using CSS - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/471510/hide-text-using-css) - This heped me figure out how to include text in HTML for screen readers, but hide it visually so as too match the design.
